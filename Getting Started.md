## Getting Started
If you use windows, the exe-files start without an additional program. \
But if you are using Linux and **don't** have wine, then install wine: \
Open the terminal-window and type for **Debian 11:**

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install wine32 wine64 -y
For **Linux Mint 20.3** open the terminal-window and type:

    sudo apt-get update
    
    sudo apt-get install wine
Unfortunately, I have no experience with other Linux versions.

Then go to the [installer directory](https://github.com/metazip/pointfrip/tree/main/installer) and choose the installer version for an installation of Pointfrip or the portable version, which is extracted with an unzipper and can then be used easily.
